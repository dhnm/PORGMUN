		<string>The Historical Security Council revisits some of the crises the Security Council has discussed throughout the ages. The committee functions exactly as the Security Council with five permanent, veto-wielding members: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the USA, France, the USSR or Russian Federation and the People´s Republic of China or Republic of China and 6 members elected by the General Assembly (increased to 10 members in 1965). The delegates have a chance to bring their perspective into some of the most divisive issues and solve them with the aid of hindsight.</string>

				<string>The case of Adolf Eichman and its implications for the post-war world order</string>
				<key>description_</key>
				<string>In May 1960, one of the most wanted Nazi figureheads of the Holocaust, SS-Obersturmbannführer Adolf Eichmann, was captured and forcibly relocated from Argentina to Israel by Mossad, an Israeli intelligence agency. Israel did not properly inform Argentina of the operation, nor did it have the permission to conduct such actions, which the Argentine Republic interpreted as a breach of its national sovereignty. Israel claimed that it had no involvement in the abduction of Adolf Eichmann.. Israel further argued that once Eichmann had reached Israel it was simply an obligation for the locals to arrest the war criminal and put him on trial. Argentine negotiations with the Israeli side failed to reach a satisfying conclusion, which is why the Argentine Republic appealed to the UN Security Council to resolve this issue. Israel was invited to the negotiating table as a non-voting party.</string>

				<string>Promoting regionally-sourced food as a means of combatting climate change and creating healthy self-sufficient communities</string>
				<key>description_</key>
				<string>It is quickly becoming clear that one of the most difficult challenges to overcome in the 21st century is the uphill battle that human-caused climate change has turned out to be. One of the underlying problems that perpetuate the enormous human impact on the environment is the way interconnected societies in today’s globalised world approach the logistical issue of finding or creating food sources for their ever-growing populations. This dilemma between self-sufficiency and high availability of cheap foodstuffs in foreign countries often results in the need to import food in a manner that produces massive amounts of emissions that have a negative effect on the environment. One of the ways to combat this is the development of sustainable, environmentally-friendly food sources that can be maintained on a regional level to prevent the destructive carbon footprint that is associated with the globalisation of food distribution.</string>

				<string>Instituting humane working conditions for migrant workers</string>
				<key>description_</key>
				<string>The United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families defines the term “migrant worker” as a person who is engaged or has been engaged in a remunerated activity in a State of which they are not citizens. The Convention itself has only been ratified by 49 states, almost exclusively sources of origin for migrant workers such as Mexico and Bangladesh. Prominent migrant-receiving states in North America, Western Europe, and in the Persian Gulf have not yet ratified the Convention and high-profile instances of the abuse and neglect of migrant workers prevail. Blatant cases of abuse such as the construction of the Qatar World Cup stadium, where workers had their passports confiscated and were forced to work excessive hours for days on end remind us that it is necessary to institutionalise the rights of migrant workers in receiving countries or face the further dehumanisation of migrant labour to a point where humans with rights and freedoms become expendable tools.</string>

				<string>Establishing formal mechanisms to prevent the diversion of arms from developed countries to conflict zones in the Middle East and North Africa</string>

				<string>Conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa continue to be fuelled by the import of foreign arms from Europe and North America, which often end up on opposing sides of the struggle sooner rather than later. With the civil war in Libya and on a larger scale the Syrian conflict being supplied by freshly minted armaments made in Eastern Europe, it is paramount that even with the ATT (Arms Trade Treaty) in place, practical means to curb the illicit transfer of weapons to organisations that could possibly violate human rights and threaten regional stability are put in place. Furthermore, it is necessary that if arms indeed do find themselves in high-risk combat zones, they need to be accounted for in every possible way in order to prevent proliferation among extremist groups in the Middle East and North Africa.</string>

				<string>Tackling the question of usage of autonomous weapon systems in military conflicts</string>
				<key>description_</key>
				<string>Slowly but steadily, the innovation achieved in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning are steering the development of the world’s militaries towards the seemingly practical choice of autonomous weaponry, which operates independently and does not require human supervision. This, however, carries significant ethical implications which have already been noticed by leaders in the AI industry. An open letter to the United Nations, signed by field experts behind Tesla and Google DeepMind, is calling on the international community to issue a ban on lethal autonomous weapons, which are already in operation in a limited scope on the border between South and North Korea. While the introduction of combat drones raised protests regarding the loss of civilian life, autonomous weapons remove the human factor completely and are able to independently make the decision to employ lethal force. While one side argues that autonomous weapons would significantly reduce the loss of human life in combat situations, it should be noted that the loss of human life is the only thing preventing warfare from reaching gargantuan and potentially catastrophic parameters and that autonomous weapons could be deployed against civilian populations with devastating efficiency. This is an extremely multifaceted problem and the international community will have to make a decision on the matter before it becomes necessary.</string>

				<string>De-escalating the conflict on the Korean peninsula</string>
				<key>description_</key>
				<string>The deep division of the Korean Peninsula ranges back to the post-World War II Soviet and American occupation and the resultant radical differences in ideology adopted by the governments on opposing sides of the 38th parallel. A Stalinist regime led by Kim Il-sung with the support of the USSR and China faced off with the American-backed administration of Syngman Rhee as both countries expressed their desire for forceful reunification under their respective ideologies. After considerable military escalation resulting in two major conflicts over a 20-year period, an uneasy status quo was reached between the two Koreas with the use of a demilitarised zone dividing them. Tensions between the two countries haven’t subsided in the slightest and lately even further escalated with incidents including the sinking of a South Korean warship and joint military exercises conducted between the United States and South Korea. Currently, the conflict is reaching new heights as the DPRK is actively working on its nuclear armament programme and more sanctions are imposed on the North Korean economy by the international community. The Security Council will have to set aside its differences and quarrels in other aspects of global politics and channel its focus on a peaceful resolution of the conflict for the greater good of the region.</string>

				<key>description_</key>
				<string>Traditional international law requires there to be “an imminent danger of attack” before preemption is permissible. As such, it has come under question what constitutes such “an imminent danger of attack” that would validate preemptive military steps. To assure that warfare is properly mandated and thus fits into the “just war” doctrine, it is imperative that the international community comprehensively addresses this question, accurately defines what preemptive warfare is, to what extent it can be allowed, the conditions that need to be met, and how this will be effectively overseen.</string>

				<string>The Geneva conventions, negotiated over 50 years ago, have increasingly come under critique as for their predisposition to hinder the fight of legitimate government forces and groups against non-state actors, thereby endangering the civilian populace it primarily aimed to protect. In an era of warfare transcendent of tradition, when allies, enemies, and civilians can no longer be distinguished by merely attire, when the structure of violent militant groups is chaotic and disorganized, and when war is no longer just a means to settle a dispute, the Geneva conventions are becoming increasingly more difficult and arguably irrational to uphold. To what extent and how can we change this fundamental source of International Humanitarian Law as not to hinder our ability to compete with modern threats whilst respecting basic human rights?</string>

It is perceived as undemocratic with the vast majority of “borrowers” being minority stakeholders while a relatively small group of industrial states holds 60 percent of the voting power. The selection process of its Managing Director has been criticized for lacking transparency and being procedurally unclear. The dominance of developed countries has no effective counter-weight even in its executive and oversight boards and it’s means of conduct tend to disregard for the interests of those in most need. The IMF is in dire need of an internal review and more importantly, reform to assure it will not be rendered obsolete in the future and will continue to fulfil its role within the international community.</string>

				<string>Privatization of Public Assets in Developing States</string>
				<key>description_</key>
				<string>Privatization has grown to become a very popular tool of economic policy in both developing and developed states. It is the process of transferring activities carried out by the government, any of its agencies, or any other state-owned enterprises to be performed by private undertakings. While the process, as a concept, may seem simple, its implementation has proven to be extremely difficult and recognized as potentially dangerous to developing states, particularly due to the larger proportion of assets privatized by international persons rather than locals. Take the example of East Timor, whose oil and natural gas reserves were estimated to be worth US $ 40 billion over 17 years and East Timor stood to gain only US $ 3.2 billion, about 8 per cent. As such, it is imperative to decide whether privatization, though in theory beneficial for the economy and local industry, is in the interest of developing states and if it is, how it should be carried out to maximize protection of developing states.</string>

UN - mediated talks have failed to reach a solution, Yemeni citizens are victims of human rights violations by all parties to the conflict and the involvement of Iran and the Gulf states pose a threat of drawing the country into the broader conflict of the Sunni-Shia divide. Meanwhile, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has seized their opportunity by claiming areas in the south and the self-declared Islamic state targeting the Houthi headquarters. Although the involvement of the international community has been substantial, it is largely up to the Arab states to act in accordance to the League’s charter and bring a halt to this dispute.</string>

In return, Saudi Arabia demanded the full withdrawal of Israel from occupied territories. Israeli leaders promptly disagreed. The Arab League has since endeavoured to alter the Arab Peace initiative in its efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestine conflict and secure the sovereignty of the Palestinian state, reintroducing it at the 2007 and 2017 summit. Yet, the negotiation process between Israel and the Arab world remains at a deadlock. The Arab League must come together and unanimously agree on the details of Palestinian status and draft a unifying course of action if the conflict with Israel is to ever be resolved.</string>

Child marriage is an issue where the resolution lies beyond the eradication of poverty, as the practice is often engrained in the cultural traditions followed for centuries. Even if laws condemning the practice are passed, cultural values take priority in many cases, warranting a more thorough solution of the complex issue at hand.</string>

Despite the signing of a peace deal following the Second Congo War, the weak Congolese governance, corruption and lawlessness in the country has allowed for ongoing violence. There are currently at least seventy armed groups operating in the eastern DRC and the situation does not seem to be improving even with 19,000 UN peacekeepers present in the area. Militant groups, the Rwandan FDLR and Ugandan ADF in particular, exploit the country’s rich natural resources to fund their operations, putting Congolese miners out of work. Millions have been forced to flee the country due to extensive human rights violations, violence and poverty - the latest UN estimates are 2.7 million internally displaced persons and 450 thousand refugees residing in bordering countries.</string>
